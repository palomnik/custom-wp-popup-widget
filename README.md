WordPress Pop-up widgets have gotten too complex (and expensive) for a lot of simple functions. Here is one that is open source and simple.
### To Use
1. Upload and install the zip file as with any WordPress plugin.
2. Create a page or post with the conent you want in the pop-up.  You can include blocks or frames from other sites (this is useful if using a subscribe widget from systeme.io for example).
3. Click on "Popup Widget" in the administration menu. Choose the options you like.
